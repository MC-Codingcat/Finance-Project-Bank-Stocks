# Finance-Project-Bank-Stocks

This is a capstone data project for the Udemy course I attended - [*Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp*](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Python_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.ROWMTA-B_ti.7380&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_80869582031_._ad_533999956687_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930046209_._li_1010700_._pd__._&matchtype=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAu9yqBhBmEiwAHTx5pxSwxNBq2_WY4jntQHplF_e6zMCn_fcyw0tFa6fCV5X_yMd_ZLpSqRoCw7oQAvD_BwE).

This project focuses on exploratory (and technical) data analysis of stock prices with pandas and visualization libraries. 
The focus is on bank stocks and how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016. The data is obtained from open data sources (Yahoo Finance data via yfinance).
Several aspects are explored in the project, e.g., heatmaps, descriptive time-series analysis, interactive plots, SMA and Bollinger Bands with Plotly and cufflinks.

GitHub does not support the preview of Plotly-created interactive plots. To view those plots, you can visit the Colab notebook via the link.
